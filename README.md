# CSE574_Final_project

# Setting up enviroment in the cluster 
1. access the cluser using this weblink : https://ood01.sol.rc.asu.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/
2.  In interactive apps select Sol Desktop.  
    - make sure to select 1 gpu 
    - I don't know if this will always be needed but at least for visualizing the demo it is needed. 
    - Model training will mostlikely be gui less ðŸ™‚
3. Open up a terminal and run the command `module load mamba`
    - This is a package manager similar to conda used by the cluster 
    - We only need this for setting up the enviroment 
    - run `mamba create -n my_vima python=3.9.18` 
    - the github repo says vima uses python3.9 so we will use the latest security update for it
    - This is probably why the below has so many issues 
4. Clone this repo by doing  the following clone 
    - note the bellow will pull the main project repo and the VIMA and VimaBench Repositories 
    ```Bash 
        git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:ramon349/CSE574_Final_project.git
    ```
5. Run the "run_install.sh" script. 

6. Setup vima as an editable package 
    - i.e run   
    ```Bash
        cd ./VIMA
        pip install -e .
    ```
7. Setup VIMABench as an editable package
    ```Bash 
        cd VimaBench
        pip install -e .
    ``` 
8. You can technically stop here if you are not using the gui.
8. Do the following: THIS IS NEEDED FOR THE GUI TO WORK  source: https://asurc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RC/pages/1799487521/OpenGL+WebGL+Support+on+Firefox
    ```
    module load gcc-12.1.0-gcc-11.2.0
    module load mesa-22.0.2-gcc-11.2.0
    ``` 
8. Open firefox and  type  about:config
    - Hit the blue square saying you accept the risk.  
    - Search for webgl.force  in the config search bar 
    - make sure that webgl.force-enable is set to true 
9.  within the VimaBench directory run
    ```bash
    python3 ./scripts/oracle/run.py 
    ```
